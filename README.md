# Comparison of Bidding Methods with AB Testing

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding." One of our clients, bombabomba.com, has decided to test this new feature and wants to conduct an A/B test to determine whether average bidding generates more conversions than maximum bidding. The A/B test has been ongoing for 1 month, and bombabomba.com now expects you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success metric for bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical tests.

This dataset contains information about a company's website, including data on the number of ads viewed and clicked by users, as well as revenue data generated from these ads. There are two separate datasets: Control and Test groups, which are available on separate sheets in an Excel file named "ab_testing.xlsx." Maximum Bidding was applied to the Control group, while Average Bidding was applied to the Test group.

Task by Task we will perform the AB Testing and analyze the results of this AB test.

Task 1: Data Preparation and Analysis
Task 2: Defining the Hypothesis of the A/B Test
Task 3: Conducting the Hypothesis Test 
Task 4: Analyze the Results
